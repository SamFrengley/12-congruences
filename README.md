This repository contains the code and data attached to [*On 12-congruences of elliptic curves*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05842) by Sam Frengley, arXiv:2208.05842. All of the code in this repository is written in [`Magma`](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). 

The directories are arranged as follows:
- In the directory `verify` we provide code which checks the claims made in the paper. 
  
- The directory `Z2_3_4` contains files related to 2, 3, and 4-congruences of elliptic curves. In particular, we record the polynomials in Theorem 3.3 and the symmetrical 2-parameter families in Remark 3.4.
  
- The directory `Z12-r` contains files related to 12-congruences. We record the equations for the surfaces Z(12, r), examples of rational points and curves of low genus on these surfaces, and the corresponding pairs of (12, r)-congruent elliptic curves.
